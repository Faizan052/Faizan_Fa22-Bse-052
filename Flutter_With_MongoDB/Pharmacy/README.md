**Pharmacy Management Flutter App with MongoDB**

This project is a mobile application built with Flutter that interfaces with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on medicine records. It allows pharmacy managers or users to effectively manage medicine details including names, prices, and quantities. The app enables seamless addition, modification, viewing, and deletion of medicines directly from the mobile interface.

The backend is powered by Node.js and connected to MongoDB, allowing the app to communicate with the database for data storage and retrieval. The frontend, built using Flutter, offers a clean and responsive UI enhanced with Glass Morphism for a modern and sleek design. This app is particularly useful for pharmacies that require a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing their stock and inventory.
