### 📱 BMI Calculator

🎯 Our Goal
The objective of this tutorial is to explore how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful and unique user interface designs. If you have a designer on board — no matter how unconventional their designs may be — we can bring those ideas to life using Flutter’s powerful toolkit.

🛠️ What You Will Create
In this project, we’re going to develop a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by Ruben Vaalt. It will be a multi-screen app 📱 featuring simple, focused functionality combined with full-on custom styling to deliver a polished and engaging user experience.

You will be able to see the finished app ✨ in action, demonstrating the potential of Flutter for building stunning, interactive applications.
